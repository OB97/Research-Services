# Research-Services
Working on Google Sheets/Excel files to gather and analyze Metrics for the department of Research Services at UPEI.

Tech Disclosure/Patents/Licenses Meeting July 11, 2023:
  - Migrate to excel (VBA)
  - Match this workbook to SB metrics (With Definitions!)
  - Should we actually migrate to Excel??
      i. Google sheets is pretty much the exact same
      ii. If I'm going to be scripting, it is much simpler to keep everything in google - assurance that scripts stay attached to workbook, version control is automatic
